# RUBIKS CUBE VIZUALIZATION + SOLVER

Made in August 2019
This was my first ever python project, meant for learning python and programing algorithems... Code has some (new) bugs. It needed to be slowed down, because moving objects to fast in vpython breaks vizualization(It used to be solved in a fraction of a second, now it lasts 5 to 10 sec). Sometimes it gets stuck in an infinite solving loop (because I programed algorithems for solving it poorly). Program then needs to be restarted.

## Dependencies 
1. python 3.x
2. Vpython (older versions seem to work better)

## Misc
clone the repo
pip install vpython
python main.py

If solver gets stuck in an infinite loop Ctr + c
If cube breaks when randomizing increase time1
